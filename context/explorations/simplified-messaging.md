# Simplified Messaging

## Current Recommendation

**Tagline:**
> A visual, collaborative UX for Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, and OpenCode

**Subtitle:**
> A visual platform to orchestrate AI coding agents. Great solo. Team-ready.

## Key Insights

### The Category Problem
There's no clean category name for "Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, OpenCode" yet:
- "AI coding tools" → too broad (includes Copilot, Cursor)
- "Agentic coding tools" → insider jargon
- "AI coding CLIs" → closest but still not widely recognized

**Solution:** Name the tools directly. The enumeration IS the category.

### What Resonates

| Word/Phrase | Why It Works |
|-------------|--------------|
| **visual** | Core unlock — these tools are invisible today, Agor makes them seeable |
| **collaborative** | Team play without forcing it |
| **UX** | Less bounded than "UI", implies the whole experience |
| **platform** | Signals depth (CLI, client, APIs) without listing them |
| **Great solo. Team-ready.** | Validates solo users, teases team play |

### What to Avoid

| Word/Phrase | Why It's Risky |
|-------------|----------------|
| "The best" | Not humble, let the product prove it |
| "Next-gen" | Vague, what gen are CLIs? |
| "Spatial layer" | Cool but not relatable |
| "Multiplayer" | Sounds like a toy |
| "Agent orchestration" | World might not be ready for this framing |
| "Workspace" | Overused, undersells it |

## Evolution of Thinking

Started with:
> "Next-gen agent orchestration for AI coding"

Problems:
- "Agent orchestration" too abstract
- "Next-gen" vague
- Doesn't name the actual tools

Evolved to:
> "The multiplayer-ready, spatial layer that connects Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, and any agentic coding tool"

Problems:
- "Multiplayer" sounds toy-like
- "Spatial layer" confusing
- Too long

Final:
> "A visual, collaborative UX for Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, and OpenCode"

Why it works:
- **Visual** — the core value prop (finally SEE sessions)
- **Collaborative** — team play implied, not forced
- **Names the tools** — searchable, precise, credible
- **UX** — comprehensive, not just a viewer

## Subtitle Options Considered

**Platform + orchestration:**
> A collaborative platform to run, visualize, and orchestrate AI coding sessions — CLI, visual client, and APIs included.

**Solo-first, scale implied:**
> A visual platform to run and orchestrate AI coding agents. Bring your team when you're ready.

**Minimal (winner):**
> A visual platform to orchestrate AI coding agents. Great solo. Team-ready.

## Future Considerations

- **Workflow/automation** — Could hint at kanban/boards: "...on boards" or "from backlog to shipped"
- **"Orchestrate armies"** — Fun but maybe too aggressive for first impression
- **Category emergence** — If "agentic CLIs" becomes a thing, could simplify the tagline
